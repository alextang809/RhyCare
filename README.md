# RhythmCare (Orbital 2021)

Android App RhythmCare for Orbital 2021.



### For Milestone 1

#### Proposed Level of Achievement

Apollo 11



#### Motivation

Statistics show that many diseases are often diagnosed when the best time for treatment has passed. Also, many people have a vague impression about how long their symptoms last when they are seeing doctors. We believe that the root of maintaining good health lies not in seeing a doctor when symptoms are severe, but in preventing diseases in a long run and strengthening the immune system.

 

#### Aim

We hope to provide users with a platform (specifically, an Android mobile app) to record their health conditions and better manage their health status through some ways (e.g. C2C services subscription, reminder functions).



#### User Stories

1. As a software engineer [those whose job requires long-time sitting without exercise] who is at risk of lumbar disc herniation, I want to record my lumber discomfort during work and get advice on exercising from professionals to ease my pain and prevent the disease in an early stage.

2. As a student who is at risk of suffering from myopia (or other eye diseases), I want to get a periodical reminder for relaxing my eyes.

3. As a psychological consultant, I want there to be a way for my “patients” (e.g. people with depression) to record their everyday emotions for me to offer better treatment. Also, I hope there is a platform to identify those facing potential psychological problems and offer early help to them.

4. As a doctor/fitness instructor/nutritionist who has spare time, I want to earn extra money by providing help and suggestions to people in need to make their life healthier.



#### Scope of Project (To be updated!)

The Android app provides a platform for users to (1) record their health conditions, which will be used to generate health guides for them, and (2) subscribe to *health management* specialist services which will provide personal health advice for them.



Now – 31st May:

1. design (prototype)

2. development plan

3. pick up necessary technologies: Git, Java, Flutter, Firebase



Features to be completed by the end of May:

1. (basic function of the app) Sign up/Log in function

   The app requires users to sign up for an account before logging in to use it. Users can also sign in using their Google account.



Features to be completed by the end of June:

1. (basic function of the app) User profile page + Setting page

   The app has a Profile bar which allows users to view their profile and there is a setting page for users to do basic settings.

   There is also a reminder setting function on the setting page for users to set reminders.

2. (1st key feature of the app) Smart Recorder and Analyser

   The **Smart Recorder** allows users to record their slight physical discomfort (which may not be urgent for them to see a doctor but indeed reflecting the possibility for them to suffer underlying chronic diseases). These records can be used for in-app analysis or presentation purposes when users go to see a doctor.

   The **Smart Analyzer** is an analysis algorithm to label symptoms (input by users) with the corresponding potential chronic diseases and compare them with people sharing the same occupations/in same age groups, after which provides users with useful healthy-living guides (e.g. recommendations for diet, exercise, periodical reminders).



Features to be completed by the end of July:

1. (2nd key feature of the app) Health Master

   The **Health Master** allows users to subscribe to health-related personal services, including 1) fitness coach; 2) nutritionists; and 3) consultants. This is a paid service, and the app allows users to pay within the app.



Features that can be extended in the future:

1. Associate with other applications (or companies) to augment the data record process

   e.g. Cooperate with Huawei to upload the health-related data recorded by their Smart Watch to the Smart Recorder to supplement the active data input by users now

2. Extend the Chat Companion to make it a chat-like interface and able to analyse voice and text messages



#### Program Flow (To be updated!!)
