# RhythmCare (Orbital 2021)

A health management app for Android users.

<br/>

## For Milestone 1

### Proposed Level of Achievement

Apollo 11

<br/>

### Motivation

Statistics show that many diseases are often diagnosed when the best time for treatment has passed. Also, many people have a vague impression about how long their symptoms last when they are seeing doctors. We believe that the root of maintaining good health lies not in seeing a doctor when symptoms are severe, but in preventing diseases in a long run and strengthening the immune system.

<br/>

### Aim

We hope to provide users with a platform (specifically, an Android mobile app) to record their health conditions and better manage their health status through some ways (e.g. health-related services subscription, reminder functions).

<br/>

### User Stories

1. As a software engineer, David have to sit still for a long time and do not have much time for him to do excises, which put him at risk of lumbar disc herniation. The RhythmCare App can record his lumber discomfort during work and offer professional advice on exercising to ease his pain and prevent the disease in an early stage.

2. As a student, Oliver is at risk of suffering from myopia (or other eye diseases), RhythmCare, however, can set a periodical reminder for relaxing my eyes.

3. As a psychological consultant, Alex want there to be a way for my “patients” (e.g. people with depression) to record their everyday emotions for them to offer better treatment. Also, he hope there is a platform to identify those facing potential psychological problems and offer early help to them.

4. As a doctor/fitness instructor/nutritionist who has spare time, Lerron want to earn extra money by providing help and suggestions to people in need to make their life healthier.

<br/>

### Scope of Project

The Android app provides a platform for users to (1) record their daily physical discomfort, which will be used to compare with a disease database to generate users' potential health issues, and (2) subscribe to personal health professionals, who can provide personal health suggestions for them.

<br/>

Features to be completed by the end of May:

1. Sign up/Login function

   The app requires users to sign up for an account before logging in to use it. Users can also sign in using their Google account.

<br/>

Features to be completed by the end of June:

1. User profile page + Settings page

   The app has a Settings bar which allows users to view their profile and do basic settings.

   [This is a could-have feature and will only be implemented if time permits.] There is also a reminder setting function on the setting page for users to set reminders.

2. Smart Recorder and Analyser

   The **Smart Recorder** allows users to record their slight physical discomfort (which may not be urgent for them to see a doctor but indeed reflecting the possibility for them to suffer underlying chronic diseases). These records can be used for in-app analysis or presentation purposes when users go to see a doctor.

   The **Smart Analyzer** is an analysis algorithm to label symptoms (input by users) with the corresponding potential chronic diseases [we will use a medical approach to conduct the analysis (e.g. assign a disease weight to each symptom)], after which provides users with useful healthy-living guides (e.g. recommendations for diet, exercise, periodical reminders).

<br/>

Features to be completed by the end of July:

1. Health Master

   The **Health Master** allows users to subscribe to their personal health professionals [Information of professionals are uploaded directly at backend.]. This is a paid service, and the app allows users to pay within the app.
